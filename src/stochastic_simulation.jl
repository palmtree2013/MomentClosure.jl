    JumpProblem(rn::ReactionSystemMod, prob::DiscreteProblem, aggregator, args...; kwargs...)

Given a `ReactionSystemMod`, DifferentialEquations [`DiscreteProblem`]
(https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/types/discrete_types/#Discrete-Problems) and [the method
for aggregating constant jumps](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/types/jump_types/#Jump-Problems),
return a corresponding  [`JumpProblem`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/types/jump_types/#Jump-Problems)
which can be solved using standard DifferentialEquations methods.

# Notes
- This function essentially massages a `ReactionSystemMod` into a form which could be used
  with DifferentialEquations SSA solvers. Namely, a `ReactionSystemMod` is converted into a
  system of [ConstantRateJumps]
  (https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/types/jump_types/#Types-of-Jumps:-Regular,-Variable,-Constant-Rate-and-Mass-Action)
  taking into account the geometrically distributed reaction products.
- The implementation here is very restricted: time-dependent propensities are currently not
  allowed; [MassActionJumps]
  (https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/types/jump_types/#Types-of-Jumps:-Regular,-Variable,-Constant-Rate-and-Mass-Action)
  cannot be used due to limitations of the `ReactionSystemMod` API, hence the SSA performance is subpar.
